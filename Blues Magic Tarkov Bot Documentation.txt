 -!flea <item_name>: This command will return the 24-hour average price and lowest available price for a specific item on the flea market. The data is fetched using the Tarkov API.
  -This command is not case sensitive and only requires 3 characters minimum.

What Files/Folders Are Created
The Blues Magic Tarkov Bot creates a config file and 2 log files into C:\Users\<user>\Documents\Blues_Magic_Tarkov_Bot upon first run and logs will update during regular use.

1. Configuration File
-File Name: config.json
 -Location: Documents\Blues_Magic_Tarkov_Bot\config.json
 -Purpose: Stores the BOT Token and Channel Name for future use, so the bot doesn’t have to ask for them every time.

2. Log Files
-Normal Log File: normal_log.txt
 -Location: Documents\Blues_Magic_Tarkov_Bot\normal_log.txt
 -Purpose: Stores general logs of bot activities, such as successful queries and responses to commands.
-Error Log File: error_log.txt
 -Location: Documents\Blues_Magic_Tarkov_Bot\error_log.txt
 -Purpose: Stores error messages and issues encountered during bot operation, such as failed API requests or incorrect queries.

How the Bot Operates
-API: The bot uses the Tarkov API (GraphQL) to fetch flea market item prices and ammo stats. https://api.tarkov.dev/graphql
-Queries: The bot listens for commands in Twitch chat that begin with !ammo or !flea. When one of these commands is typed, the bot will query the appropriate data source.
-Logging: The bot logs all interactions in the normal_log.txt file and any errors in the error_log.txt file.
-Configuration: On the first run, the bot stores the BOT Token and Channel Name in config.json so you don’t have to enter them every time.

Troubleshooting
-Bot Not Starting
 -Ensure that you've entered a valid BOT Token and Channel Name.
  -If there’s an issue with the token, you may need to generate a new OAuth token from Twitch OAuth Token Generator.
-Bot Not Responding to Commands
 -Make sure the bot is correctly connected to the Twitch channel.
  -Verify that the bot has the appropriate permissions in the channel to read and respond to messages.
-Check the error_log.txt file for details on any issues.
